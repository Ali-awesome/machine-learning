    "* NumPy is a python library.\n",
    "* Can work in the domain of linear algebra, fourier transformation and matrices.\n",
    "* NumPy stands for Numerical Python.\n",
    "* NumPy uses the array object called `ndarray`.\n",
    "* NumPy array is faster than list because it uses a memory allocation system named **contiguous memory allocation**. [More Info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-lists-vs-numpy-arrays/)\n",
    "* **Contiguous Memory Allocation**: Contiguous memory allocation is basically a method in which a single contiguous section/part of memory is allocated to a process or file needing it. Because of this all the available memory space resides at the same place together, which means that the freely/unused available memory partitions are not distributed in a random fashion here and there across the whole memory space.  [More Info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-contiguous-and-noncontiguous-memory-allocation/) and a [Youtube](https://youtu.be/eHzUtmPGfJw) video.\n",

    "* NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in **C or C++**.\n",
    "* The source code for NumPy is located at this [github repository](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)."

    "### Some important points about Numpy arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can create an N-dimensional array in python using `Numpy.array()`.\n",
    "* The array is by default Homogeneous, which means data inside an array must be of the same Datatype. (**Note you can also create a structured array in python**).\n",
    "* Element-wise operation is possible.\n",
    "* Numpy array has various functions, methods, and variables, to ease our task of matrix computation.\n",
    "* Elements of an array are stored contiguously in memory. For example, all rows of a two-dimensioned array must have the same number of columns. Or a three dimensioned array must have the same number of rows and columns on each card."
